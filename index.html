        <h2>🎮 1. Overview</h2>
        <p>The game is played between 2 to 4 players.</p>
        <p>A game lasts about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>
          The player who made the highest score with both dice begins, and then
          the player to his left continues and so on. The goal being to reach 50
          points, the players take turns.
        </p>
        <p>
          First move : The player rolls two dice and moves his piece to the
          square. When a player comes across a simple 'Quizz' box, they must
          scan the QR code of the rules and then scroll down the page to land on
          'Launch game'. By clicking on it, he will land on a button and will
          have to click on it so that fate will assign him a random difficulty
          (between EASY, MEDIUM & HARD).
        </p>
        <h3>⭐ EASY card</h3>
        <p>
          EASY card: if the player answers well to the question, he gains 2
          points. if the player answers wrong to the question, he does not lose
          points.
        </p>

        <h3>⭐⭐ MEDIUM card</h3>
        <p>
          MEDIUM card: if the player answers well to the question, he gains 4
          points. If the player answers wrong to the question, he loses 2
          points.
        </p>

        <h3>⭐⭐⭐ HARD card</h3>
        <p>
          HARD card: if the player answers well to the question, he gains 6
          points. if the player answers wrong to the question, he loses 5
          points.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a player comes across a 'Quizz' box with 'Choose', they will have
          to choose the level of difficulty they want, then draw a card on the
          board and respond to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a player falls on a BONUS square, they earn 3 points. When a
          player falls on a MALUS square, they lose 2 points.
        </p>
        <p>The first player to reach 50 points wins the game.</p>
